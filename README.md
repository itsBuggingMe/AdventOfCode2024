# Advent of Code 2024 in one line #

Every part of every day was done at first in one line, then combined into one single line.
No libraries were used - the code should compile on dotnet 6 and upwards.

The formatting for the code was done in the `AdventOfCodeFormatter` project, as well as some manual tweaking.
